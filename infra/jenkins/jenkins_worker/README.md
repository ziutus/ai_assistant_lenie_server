# Jenkins support for Lenie-AI

Jenkins is an open-source automation server designed to streamline software development processes. It enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to efficiently build, test, and deploy code, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.
By incorporating Jenkins into the Lenie-AI project, we automate essential development workflows, such as code testing, building, and deployment pipelines. This improves development speed, reduces the chance of human error, and ensures our project adheres to a professional CI/CD pipeline, fostering team collaboration and high software quality.
